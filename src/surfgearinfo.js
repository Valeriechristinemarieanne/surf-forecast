                                    any sense of feeling in your extremities.
                                    Get down your local watersports retailer and
                                    get the guys in the know to fit you up as
                                    the correct sizing of a wettie is crucial to

                                    being separated. They are at least as long
                                    as the length of the board so that if you
                                    wipeout it‚Äôll be out of the way by the time
                                    you surface but close enough for you to hope

                                    to choose from when surfing. Only 2 of these
                                    are really suitable for the beginner. Foam,
                                    boards which are generally blue and yellow
                                    are the most forgiving surfboard to start on
                                    and can be rented at most surf beaches.
                                    Although they are the most forgiving, they
                                    also have limited suitability for the
                                    improving beginner due to their very basic
                                    design.
