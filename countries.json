                    Atlantic's swells make it an attractive surfing destination,
                    especially given it's close proximity to Europe. Morocco
                    delivers her most tasty waves during fall, winter and
                    spring. The Moroccan coast itself is absolutely humongous!
                    Morocco has a 1,835 kilometers long coastline with ideal
                    surfing conditions. Morocco receives thousands of surfers
                    every winter looking for the best surf resorts in Morocco.
                    The Atlantic coastline of Morocco is fantastic for surfing
                    and most beaches are easily accessed either by public
                    transport or with your own vehicle. If you’re planning to be
                    in Morocco for a couple of weeks, the following list of
                    Morocco surf spots will help you plan your trip. I’ve listed
                    them from the southernmost destination, Agadir to the surf
                    spots located farther north along the coast. I’ve also
                    included Dakhla to the list of best surfing spots in
                    Morocco."

        "description": "The best thing about Imsouane is the extraordinary surf conditions. The swell peaks at the point and sweeps into the huge bay, connecting three peaks to form one lengthy, peeling, chilled-out ride in. If you catch the wave through each of the three peaks, you’ll be surfing for at least two minutes, or maybe more. The feeling of catching one of these mellow waves on a sizeable day is second to none!",

To the left, around the headland, is Banana Point and for the experienced surfer a gem lies between the two spots. Can be crowded on the weekends with locals. Relaxed vibe and great cafe on the beach.",
